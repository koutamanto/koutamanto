(High Hopes - Panic! At The Disco)

I've been living a life with high hopes.

A normal life's not enough for me, I thought.

And I decided to be a President,to make a lot of money that I can't spend all of them.

Also in engineering, I've been creating the new things not the existing.

#### devchat

#### Galileo

#### EleClone

**Digital Cloning Technology**

#### Vaccano LLC
My company(2023/4/17-2023/11) <br>
I was CTO there.

(Love Yourz - J. Cole)

That's right. I fulfilled my dream once.
But yes. The end has come.
For various reasons, I decided to quit the company I started.
Not a penny of money remained. I did not earn any money.

But there were many things I could learn.
#### Knowledge for business
- Target.
- Cost
- Profit
- Legal

and I realized that
> "Being technically great is not the same as being profitable."

In the next place, I will make big profits, big innovation, and big money.
